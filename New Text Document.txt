I think the simialrites and differances between GUI and command lines is quite interesting. GUI is much 
more straight forward and easy to comperhand and is defeinetly the most consumer friendly, I do think there is an art
to it by making it look aesethically pleasing and easy to naviagte. Command lines may seem scary at first but it is 
an easy enough concept to wrap your head around once you understand that it is like a GUI but much more technical.
